        <p>Professionally, I am an electrical and computer engineer, who has been accumulating experience since graduating university in 2013. Much of my recent work has been designing digital logic for FPGA applications. I also have experience with low level software, circuit board design and server design.</p>
        <p>Personally, I am a thinker, creator and an athlete. I enjoy partaking of and participating in arts and sciences. My favorite creative outlet is cooking. At times I dig into technical topics ranging from molecular biology to quantum mechanics. When I need a break I hop on my bicycle or grab my backpack and head for the hills.</p>
